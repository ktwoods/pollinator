This project (that I really do need to come up with some sort of snappy name for) is a simple single-user application that combines a garden planner with a wildlife log for a more granular approach to wildlife gardening. Different species of pollinators and other garden visitors have a wide range of different needs and life cycles; this tool makes it easier to cross-reference the species you want to support with the plants you hoped would support them.

This started as a graduate school final project in spring 2018, but was always intended as (1) an excuse to keep learning the technology and languages involved, and (2) a functional customized database for my own purposes, as the most granular and data-focused gardener I know. I've been working on it off and on since then, and a live version of the application can be viewed <a href="http://bit.ly/pollinateproject">here</a>. Feel free to fiddle! (Although the original data in this is my research and observations, I've moved to maintaining those on a private database)

Because I've been using this as a working database since the moment it was created, my focus has been on implementing the basic intended functionality â€” add, edit, and remove capabilities for all attributes, and some cross-linking between species profiles for comparative purposes. The web design is very much a placeholder for now, and there is very little in the way of graceful error handling or explanatory text.
